I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer and specialize in the application of Deep Learning. My long term mission is to use AI in Medicine and Healthcare that will be used routinely for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. I love utilizing my time in helping my peers learn, connect and grow as a community. I am a Microsoft Student Partner, a deeplearning.ai Ambassador and an active volunteer for Google Developer Groups Kolkata. I love taking sessions and speaking at various conferences for promoting student knowledge on developer products and platforms.
